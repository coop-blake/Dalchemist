# Dalchemist

For assisting POS Tasks that rely on data from domain specific data sources. Dalchemist has been engineered for workflows specific to First Alternative Coop but could be modified to fit your own needs.

This repository provides commands for [building and packaging a desktop application](./Documentation/Application.md) for distribution. 

This app that is built will be tied specifically to our Google sheets which it will be unable to access without a service certificate. You could point it at your own sheets and use your own service certificate. 

Some terminal commands to help you build your own inventory sheets, that were orinally originally developed in this repository, have been refactored in Rust and can be found in [this other repository](https://github.com/coop-blake/DSN2Sheet). These are helpful in getting your data out of a DSN and into a Google Sheet.


To run the npm commands below, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on a host machine of your choosing.

You will also need access to a terminal. Terminal commands are represented like `this` in the documentation.

## ‚ú® Getting Started

## ![Icon](./icon/icon32.png) Run the Desktop App

The Desktop App is intended to provide a packaged, end user interface that can be downloaded, installed and used without any additional configuration or setup. Aside what is presented in the graphical interface.

Dalchemist uses the [Electron framework](https://www.electronjs.org/), which packages Dalchemist as a Desktop Application on various platforms. This repository provides commands to run and package the Desktop App. Some of this configuration was borrowed from the [Electron React Boilerplate](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/) . Thanks! üôè

A google API service certificate will need to be provided in order to load the data needed by the interface. This certificate should be placed in `./src/Google/Inventory/CertAndLogs/googelCert.json`

The desktop app can be transpiled and ran in debug/development mode using the following command.

`npm run start:App`

You can also build a packaged Desktop App installer for Linux, Mac, or Windows.

`npm run package:App`

More details can be found in [üìÅ Documentation/](./Documentation)[üìù Application.md](./Documentation/Application.md)
